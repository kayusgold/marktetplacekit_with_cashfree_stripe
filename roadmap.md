MarketplaceKit Software Roadmap
-----------------------

This brief document outlines to development plan for MarketplaceKit and will be updated over time. It outlines planned addons, themes, mobile applications and other elements.

***Note: This may change in time, depending on user suggestions***


## Core   
### Minimal Viable Version (MarketplaceKit core)

This is the base of the application that will enable developers to modify the system without changing the core code via Addons (AKA Modules) & themes. 

### Headless CMS

Enable the marketplace to be used in a headless fashion and expose an API. This is useful for those who want to create their own mobile application, or use something other than PHP (e.g. nuxt.js, next.js etc.).

### React Native Application (Demo)

An example react native application will be built to allow developers to easily modify it their needs.

### Basic Developer Documentation

Documents that let developers know how to customize the marketplace easily.
